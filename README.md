Problem Statement
Hunger is not caused only by lack of food but also by poor crop predictions, food waste,
and inefficient distribution.
Globally, 30-40% of food produced is lost between harvest and consumption,
equivalent to 1.3 billion tons annually. In Sub-Saharan Africa, post-harvest losses reach
37% for fruits and vegetables due to inadequate storage, poor transportation, and lack
of real-time quality monitoring. This represents $4 billion in economic losses and
directly contributes to food insecurity affecting 282 million people in the region.
Small-scale farmers lack access to predictive analytics, optimal storage conditions
monitoring, and efficient market connections, resulting in preventable food waste while
communities face hunger.
Proposed Solution
Our Predictive Food Security Platform will:
Use real-time weather, soil, and satellite data. Apply AI models to predict crop yield and
detect risks (drought, pests, floods). Provide dashboards for farmers, suppliers, and
governments to make better decisions. Connect surplus food producers with shortage
areas to reduce waste.
And Integrate Post-Harvest Management Platform:
•
•
•
•
•
•
IoT Sensor Network: Deploy low-cost sensors monitoring temperature,
humidity, CO2 levels in storage facilities
AI Predictive Analytics: IBM Z-powered machine learning predicting optimal
harvest timing and storage duration
Blockchain Supply Chain: Immutable tracking from farm to market ensuring
food safety and reducing fraud
Dynamic Market Matching: Real-time connection between farmers and
buyers based on quality predictions
Mobile Advisory System: SMS/app-based alerts for farmers on storage
conditions and market opportunities
Technical Architecture
oooIBM Z Mainframe: Core processing for complex agricultural algorithms
and transaction processing
Hybrid Cloud: Edge computing for real-time IoT data processing with
mainframe analytics
AI/ML Models: Crop quality prediction, spoilage prevention, demand
forecasting
o Mobile Interface: Progressive web app for low-bandwidth environments
Impact
With this platform, farmers can plan better, governments can respond faster, and
communities can avoid shortages. This solution reduces hunger, cuts food waste, and
supports SDG 2: Zero Hunger while building resilience against climate change.
How to be Unique
1. Focus on Underexplored Sub-problems
Instead of general "food distribution," target:
•
 Post-harvest loss prevention (30-40% of food spoils before reaching
consumers)
•
 Nutritional quality optimization rather than just quantity
•
 Climate-resilient crop planning using predictive analytics
•
 Food fraud detection in supply chains
•
 Urban vertical farming optimization
2. Leverage IBM Z's Unique Strengths
Most teams will build generic apps. Use IBM Z's actual capabilities:
