# Food_Security-Zero_Hunger
Our Predictive Food Security Platform will: Use real-time weather, soil, and satellite data. Apply AI models to predict crop yield and detect risks (drought, pests, floods). Provide dashboards for farmers, suppliers, and governments to make better decisions. Connect surplus food producers with shortage areas to reduce waste.
